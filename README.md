# moxy-ui

Moxy UI - Charts, graphs, and UI elements for the front end.

This is still in early stages. I haven't built a state management tool to work with these UI components yet but maybe I can make these compatible with some existing projects (like React versions, making MoxyScript work easily with Redux, and adding advanced caching features that rival Gatsby in terms of performance.
